# 🚀 Code Craft

Code Craft is a modern, browser-based coding platform that allows users to write, execute, save, and share code snippets instantly — without any local setup. It simplifies coding practice, experimentation, and collaboration through a clean and intuitive interface.

---



Learning and sharing code often requires multiple tools such as editors, compilers, and sharing platforms. This fragmented workflow increases setup time and creates barriers for beginners and quick experimentation.

---



Code Craft provides an all-in-one web-based environment where users can write and run code directly in the browser, personalize their editor, and share snippets via unique links — eliminating setup overhead and improving productivity.
